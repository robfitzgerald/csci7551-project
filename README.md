## Simulation of Static Traffic Assignment

this project is a simulation of the textbook techniques for assigning vehicle traffic to a road network for a static snapshot of the expected distribution of congestion on the system.  it is based on methods described in Chapter 10 of [Modelling Transport](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781119993308) by Juan de Dios Ort√∫zar and Luis G. Willumsen.

### a few choice words before you run this

this application is still incomplete. in it's current example, it loads the graph as described in the file `three_road_network.graph`, which has three different routes between the node 'A' and node 'O'.

the driver file, msaSim.test.cpp declares one trip for 50 vehicles per time unit from node "A" to node "O".

all functions are currently logging like it's going out of style. hopefully the logs can show you the iterative search process is _trying_ to happen. i sometimes find that it terminates with a child process error, and sometimes it hangs, and sometimes it terminates with a seg fault.

some terminologies in the logging:  the "selected" and "frontier" lists for the "forward" and "backward" search are exactly what they sound like. you will see a printout of both lists for both directions at the end of the search iteration. you _should_ see a single node added to the selected list each iteration for each sub-search. it _should_ be the one with minimal cost.
